## the problem

Court forms are a pain. The typical process for filling these forms has two major issues:

-   tedium
-   data organization

The typical process looks like this:

1. First, you dig through your emails and notes to gather all the relevant info.
1. Then you do a bunch of mental gymnastics to decide what info goes where.
1. Then you have to type it all in. And a lot of the info gets repeated across multiple forms, so you have to type it over and over.

In the end, the info is in your pdf forms. This is an improvement over having it scattered throughout the original emails and notes, but it's not searchable or easy to extract for use elsewhere. We also haven't necessarily mapped the original source (email, note) to each piece of data entered into the pdf.

## the solution

CourtFormTool fixes these problems.

All you have to do is answer a series of straightforward questions about your matter. For each of your answers, you can easily associate the source document (email, note).

Once you complete the questionnaire, CourtFormTool calculates all of your client's relations, etc. and produces completed versions of all of the necessary forms.

CourtFormTool doesn't just eliminate the tedium of filling out court forms. It also creates an organized and easy-to-use source of truth for all of your matter's data.

## the benefits

CourtFormTool frees up attorneys and their staff to focus on real problems. It also eliminates simple errors and vastly speeds up requests for backup.

## the team

CourtFormTool is produced by an experienced attorney working with a software developer. We're intentionally keeping the product focused enough that we can effectively keep the team **tiny**. This lets us be super-responsive to our customers, so that the product can reach its full potential.

## security

We're laser focused on the security of your client's data. For now, CourtFormTool ensures security by storing your data on your computer. This security comes at the cost of convenience. In the future, we may add a cloud storage option, which would allow you to access your data from anywhere.
