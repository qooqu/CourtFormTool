## CourtFormTool

## the problem

Court forms are a pain. If we dig in to the process of filling these forms, we'll find two major issues:

-   tedium
-   data organization and availability

The typical process looks like this:

1. First, you have to dig through your emails and notes to gather all the relevant info.
1. Then you have to do a bunch of mental gymnastics to decide what info goes where.
1. Then you have to type it all in. And a lot of the info gets repeated across multiple forms, so you have to type it over and over.

In the end, the info is in your pdf forms. This is an improvement to having it scattered throughout the original emails and notes, but we can do better. We also haven't necessarily mapped the original source (email, note) to each piece of data entered into a pdf.

## the solution

CourtFormTool fixes these problems.

All you have to do is answer a series of straightforward questions about your matter. For each of your answers, you can easily associate the source document (email, note).

Once you complete the questionnaire, CourtFormTool calculates all of your client's relations, etc. and produces completed versions of all of the necessary forms.

CourtFormTool doesn't just eliminate the tedium of filling out court forms. It also creates an organized and easy-to-use source of truth for all of your matter's data.

## the benefits

CourtFormTool frees up attorneys and their staff to focus on real problems. It also eliminates simple errors and vastly speeds up requests for backup.
